        <h5>Terms</h5>
        <p>
            It's free to create as many search indices here as you want.
            Note, a search index can contain multiple sites, as many as you want.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are still using your index 30 days after it was created, we will require upon you a small fee.
            The fee is <strong>$4.99 per month</strong> per index.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are anonymous until you decide to keep an index,
            whereby we shall require a valid email address from you, 
            so that we can send you payment instructions.
        </p>
        <h5>What sites would you like to search?</h5>
        <p>
            Add just a couple of sites to start with. You can always add more later as well as remove those that you are no longer interested in.
