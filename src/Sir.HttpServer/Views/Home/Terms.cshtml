        <p>
            <u><i>CrawlCrawler</i></u> is a pay-as-you-go search service that 
            hosts search indices and keeps them updated on a regular basis. 
            CrawlCrawler provides a HTTP query API and GUI for users to use when they interact with their indices.
        </p>
        <p>
            <u><i>Users</i></u> create search indices here.
            Users decide what content to include in their indices.
            Users use this service to query their indices.
        </p>
        <h2>Payment</h2>
        <p>
            At <i>crawlcrawler.com</i> users may create as many search indices as they want to, for free.
        </p>
        <p>
            If users are still using their indices after 30 days from creating them
            and they want to continue doing so for another 30 days then 
            CrawlCrawler will require that they pay <strong>€4.99</strong>. 

        </p>
        <h2>Personally identifyable information</h2>
        <p>
            Users are completely and 100% anonymous to CrawlCrawler.
            The only things CrawlCrawler can see in its logs are queries from unknown users.
