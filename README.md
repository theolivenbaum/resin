# &#9084; Resin Extensible Search Engine

Resin is a document database that wants to be a search engine so it's been paired with a search index that happens to represent a vector space, a quite powerful concept if you think about it, any vector space, really, as long as it's a (Sir) IModel, which I still feel will be quite powerful to most, but to others, IModel will get in the way (See "Contribute").

## Spaces

Built from embeddings that are extracted from document fields during the tokenization phase of the write operation, spaces are
persisted on disk as bitmaps that are scannable in a streaming fashion, while putting little pressure on memory in doing so, only what amounts to the size of a single graph node, which is usually very small, enabling the possibility to scan indices that are larger than memory. 

Spaces are configured by implementing IModel or IStringModel.

If you have only embeddings, no documents, you might still find some of the APIs useful for when you
want to build searchable spaces, e.g. (Sir.VectorSpace) GraphBuilder and PathFinder. If you use MathNet.Numerics your vectors are already fully compatible. 

## In- and out-of-proc

There is both an in-proc, NHibernate-like API in that there are sessions, a factory, and the notion of a unit of work, as well as __JSON-friendly HTTP API that can be extended to support XML or any other document format__, if you are one to fully utilize Asp.Net Core 3 MVC's content negotiating capabilities.

## Write, map, materialize and page

__Write data flow__: documents, that consists of keys and values, are persisted on disk and turned into vectors, through tokenization (IModel.Tokenize), each embedding placed in a graph (see "Balancing"), each node referencing one or more documents, that we turn into a bitmap that we append to a file on disk, as a segment of a column index that by the full powers of what is .Net parallellism will be touched during mapping of queries that target this column.

__Map data flow__: a query, representing one or more terms, each term identifying both a column and a value, turns into a document that turns into a tree of vectors (through tokenization), each node representing a boolean set operation over your space (AND, OR, NOT), each compared to the vectors of your space by performing binary search over the nodes of your column bitmap files, so, luckily, not all vectors, only, but this is not guaranteed to always be the case, log(N) vectors, but sometimes more. How often and how many more depends to some degree on how you balanced your tree and to another, hopefully much smaller degree, and this goes for all probabilistic models, and we're probabilistic because two vectors that are not identical to another can be merged (see "Balancing"), on pure chance.

__Materialize operation__: each node in the query tree that recieved a mapping to one or more postings lists ("lists of document references") during the map step now materializes their postings and we can join them with those of their the parent, through intersection, union or deletion, and, once the tree's been materialized all the way down to the root, we have a list of references that we can sort by relevance so we can get on with what it is we really want, which is to materialize a list of scored and sorted documents that are __paged__.

## Balancing (algorithm)

Balancing the binary tree that represents your space is done by adjusting the merge factor ("IdenticalAngle") and the fold factor ("FoldAngle"). 

The location in the index, of each vector, is determined by calculating its angle to the node it most resembles. If the angle is greater than or equal to IdenticalAngle the two nodes merge. If it is not a new node is added to the binary tree. If the angle is greater than FoldAngle it is added as a left child to the node or, if that slot is taken, to the next left node that has a empty left slot, otherwise as a right child.

IdenticalAngle and FoldAngle are properties of IModel.

## Apps

- __Sir.HttpServer__: HTTP search service (read, write, query naturally or w/QL)
- __Sir.DbUtil__: write, validate and query via command-line

## Libs (.Net Core 3 apps can embedd and extend these)

- __Sir.KeyValue__: key/value/document System.IO.Stream-based database
- __Sir.VectorSpace__: hardware accellerated computations over and stream based storage of vectors and spaces
- __Sir.Search__: in-proc search engine (SessionFactory, WriteSession, ReadSession)

## Contribute

If IModel sometimes gets in your way, as I anticipate it might, then please undertand it is only an interface written by some random guy, thus not written in stone. PR's are most welcome.
